      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been referred to a photographer by a friend, but still been unsure of the quality of their work due to lack of exposure? I am a programmer. I am making a site to showcase the works of a photographer. It will show her different works and styles of photography to generate interest and business. Seeing her work will make it clear of what can be done for you, and with her contact and social media platforms available it will be easy to connect.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is for those seeking a photographer. If you are in need of personal portraits, family pictures, or other styles, this site will showcase the works of Bee and will help you see what could be possible for you. This is also a site where you can enjoy the beauty of photography by viewing the works of Bee. Other photographers may also be interested in the site to acquire more ideas for their own</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
